# Zordon Wallet

> Zordon is an iOS Zcash wallet that holds only ZEC, onboards via NEAR FastAuth, and uses NEAR Intents for non‑custodial cross‑chain receive and pay. It guides users with a concise in‑app assistant sourced from curated docs.

Zordon prioritizes privacy and non‑custodial routes. When a trustless route to ZEC is unavailable, the app refuses the swap and explains alternatives.
